# ZotShelf: Your Digital Bookshelf for Zotero 

ZotShelf extracts covers from the EPUBs in your [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) library and displays them in a beautiful, browsable grid. Quickly see your entire digital book collection at a glance and access your books with a single tap.

The app is currently in closed beta testing. Contact me if you would like to test it at appbugge@gmail.com. There are some bugs with choosing collections. THe app does not show all the collections in the account.

## How It Works

1. Set up your Zotero credentials - Enter your Zotero username, user ID, and API key in the app settings
2. Connect to your library - ZotShelf securely connects to your Zotero account and finds all your EPUB books.
3. Extract covers - The app automatically extracts cover art from each EPUB file in your library.
4. Browse your collection - Explore your digital bookshelf, filter by collections, and tap any cover to start reading.
5. Stay updated - Pull down to refresh whenever you add new books to your Zotero library.
